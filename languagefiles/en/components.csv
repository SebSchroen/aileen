"components/c-301/displayTitle/","What is Copyright?"
"components/c-301/body/","Copyright is a <b>legal right</b> granting creators <b>exclusive control</b> over their original literary and artistic works. As part of Intellectual Property (IP) law, it safeguards 'works of authorship' by empowering creators to manage how their creations are <b>used and distributed</b>."
"components/c-301/instruction/","Click on the panels below to learn more about copyright."
"components/c-301/_items/0/front/","What is protected?"
"components/c-301/_items/0/back/body/","Copyright protects the <b><em>concrete expression</em> of an idea</b>, not the idea itself. It applies to tangible literary and artistic works like novels, songs, paintings, and software, giving creators <b>control over their specific manifestations</b>."
"components/c-301/_items/1/front/","What are the conditions?"
"components/c-301/_items/1/back/body/","To be copyrighted, a work must be expressed in a <b><em>concrete way</em></b> (not abstract ideas) and be <b><em>original</em></b>. Originality means it's an <b>intellectual creation by a human author</b>, reflecting their personality and creative choices. This <b>human authorship is fundamental</b>, especially in German and EU law."
"components/c-301/_items/2/front/","What are the rights of the owner?</b>"
"components/c-301/_items/2/back/body/","Owners gain <b>exclusive rights to reproduce, distribute, and publicly communicate</b> their work. They also hold <b>moral rights</b>, including disclosure, integrity, and attribution, ensuring control. Copyright generally lasts for the <b>author's lifetime plus 70 years</b> in EU Member States."
"components/c-302/title/","Copyright and AI"
"components/c-302/displayTitle/","And why is this important for AI?"
"components/c-302/body/","Recall the Turing Test from the first part of this course: The output of AI systems has gotten so good, that much of is is hard to distinguish from human content. And much of the human content out there on the internet is protected by copyright laws. In this lesson, we will address three questions:"
"components/c-302/_items/0/title/","Does the training of AI violate copyright law?"
"components/c-302/_items/1/title/","Can the output of AI systems infringe copyright work?"
"components/c-302/_items/2/title/","Is the output copyrightable?"
"components/c-303/title/","AI training and copyright"
"components/c-303/displayTitle/","AI training <em> might </em> violate copyright law"
"components/c-303/body/","The question of whether training AI models on copyrighted material constitutes infringement is a central and highly debated legal issue. It involves complex interpretations of existing copyright laws and the emergence of new regulations, particularly in the EU. Understanding this area requires examining both the technical nature of AI models and the legal frameworks governing data use."
"components/c-303/instruction/","Click on the panels below to learn more about this complex issue."
"components/c-303/_items/0/title/","Models do not <em>store</em> copyright data"
"components/c-303/_items/0/body/","AI models typically do not store exact copies of copyrighted works. Instead, they learn by extracting and encoding abstract concepts into numerical representations. This process of decomposition and abstraction means the trained model itself is not a direct copy, and thus typically does not violate copyright."
"components/c-303/_items/1/title/","During training, this is an ongoing debate"
"components/c-303/_items/1/body/","AI models are trained on vast amounts of data, often including copyrighted materials scraped from the internet. Using this data without explicit authorization can be considered copyright infringement. In the US, proponents often argue this falls under 'fair use.'

"components/c-306/_items/1/front/","AI as a tool, not an author"
"components/c-306/_items/1/back/body/","While AI can produce works that <em>could</em> be protected, copyright depends on <b>sufficient human intervention</b>.

"components/c-401/_items/0/front/","Personal Data"
"components/c-401/_items/0/back/body/","Personal data refers to <b>any information that can identify a living person</b>, either directly or indirectly. Examples include <em>names, identification numbers, location data, or any data that can be used to ascertain an individual's identity.</em>"
"components/c-401/_items/1/front/","Processing"
"components/c-401/_items/1/back/body/","Data processing means <b> any </b> action performed on personal data. This includes <em>collecting it, storing it, using it, sharing it, changing it, or even deleting it.</em> Such processing can be carried out manually or through automated systems."
"components/c-401/_items/2/front/","Consent"
"components/c-401/_items/2/back/body/","Consent means <b>clear, voluntary, specific, and informed permission</b> from an individual for their personal data to be used. It requires an <em>unambiguous affirmative action</em> and cannot be implied."
"components/c-402/title/","How AI processes personal data"
"components/c-402/displayTitle/","How AI processes personal data"
"components/c-402/body/","Artificial Intelligence systems heavily rely on data for their functionality. Understanding how personal data is handled at different stages of AI development and deployment is crucial for navigating GDPR compliance. Select the tabs to explore each stage."
"components/c-402/instruction/","Select the tabs to learn more."
"components/c-402/_items/0/tabTitle/","Data Collection & Training"
"components/c-402/_items/0/title/","Stage 1: Data Collection & Initial Training"
"components/c-402/_items/0/body/","AI systems are built on an <b>'enormous appetite for data'</b>. This initial stage involves collecting vast quantities of data to train algorithms to detect patterns and make predictions. If the data is sufficiently granular, it can allow <b>re-identification of individuals</b>, meaning personal data is involved from the very outset. This accumulation of relevant data is a key factor for AI-related issues, as it is often used to create <em>personality profiles or for individualized services.</em>"
"components/c-402/_items/1/tabTitle/","Model Development & Risks"
"components/c-402/_items/1/title/","Stage 2: AI Model Development & Data Leakage"
"components/c-402/_items/1/body/","During the development phase, AI models are created from the collected training data. Even after a model is trained, it might inadvertently <b>'leak'</b> some of the personal data it was trained on through methods like <em>model inversion or membership inference attacks.</em> This means the trained model itself can contain personal information, and its sharing or transfer to third parties is considered <b>'processing' under GDPR</b>, regardless of whether the original data was raw or pseudonymized."
"components/c-402/_items/2/tabTitle/","Application"
"components/c-402/_items/2/title/","Stage 3: AI Applications"
"components/c-402/_items/2/body/","The final stage involves deploying the trained AI model to make real-world predictions and decisions. This <b>'inference stage'</b> processes personal data to derive new information, for example, a bank using an AI to predict loan default risk. This application of AI to personal data constitutes <b>'further processing'</b> and must adhere to GDPR principles, as it directly impacts individuals through <em>automated decisions and recommendations.</em>"
"components/c-403/title/","Frictions between AI and GDPR"
"components/c-403/displayTitle/","Frictions between AI and GDPR"
"components/c-403/body/","When companies use Artificial Intelligence, it often relies on your personal information. While the GDPR aims to protect you, AI's unique characteristics can create specific challenges for individuals interacting with these systems within a company."
"components/c-403/instruction/","Click on the panels below to learn more."
"components/c-403/_items/0/title/","Purpose limitation"
"components/c-403/_items/0/body/","AI systems often use your information in ways that <b>weren't initially explained or agreed upon.</b>"
"components/c-403/_items/1/title/","Transparency"
"components/c-403/_items/1/body/","Decisions made by AI can be hard to understand. It's difficult for a company to explain <em> why </em> an AI reached a particular conclusion about you, making it challenging to know how its decisions are reached."
"components/c-403/_items/2/title/","Data minimization and storage limitation"
"components/c-403/_items/2/body/","AI thrives on large amounts of data, which often means <b>more of your information is collected than strictly necessary.</b> This also makes it difficult to know when or if your data will ever be deleted."
"components/c-403/_items/3/title/","Accuracy"
"components/c-403/_items/3/body/","Data must be accurate and up-to-date. However, AI's <b>'black box' nature</b> makes it challenging to detect and correct inaccurate information. A key nuance is that while input data must be accurate, AI's outputs are often <b>probabilistic prognoses</b>, which complicates the application of this principle."
"components/c-404/title/","Key recommendations"
"components/c-404/displayTitle/","Recommendations for users"
"components/c-404/body/","As an end-user, your actions can significantly impact data protection within company AI systems. Here's what you need to know:"

"components/c-404/_items/0/front/","No personal data without consent"
"components/c-404/_items/0/back/body/","As an end-user, <b>never input personal data belonging to others</b> into an AI system without confirming a clear, explicit legal basis, such as their <em>specific and informed consent.</em>"
"components/c-404/_items/1/front/","Anonymize data"
"components/c-404/_items/1/back/body/","If your role involves handling or inputting data that contributes to AI systems, <b>prioritize using anonymization or pseudonymization techniques</b> to remove or obscure personal identifiers. These methods are vital for reducing the risk of <em>re-identification and align with the principle of data minimization.</em>"
"components/c-404/_items/2/front/","Review your consent"
"components/c-404/_items/2/back/body/","As an individual providing your own data, <b>carefully scrutinize requests for your consent,</b> especially if they are vague, implicit, or presented as a default opt-out. GDPR requires consent to be <b>'freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous,'</b> highlighting that <em>broad or implied agreements often fall short.</em>"

"components/c-514/_feedback/correct/","That's correct! Company X is acting as a Deployer because it is using the AI system for its own operations and services, rather than creating, selling, or importing it for commercial distribution."
"components/c-514/_feedback/_incorrect/notFinal/","Not quite. Revisit the 'Key Roles in the EU AI Act Ecosystem' section. Consider whether Company X is creating, selling, or simply using the AI tool."
"components/c-514/_feedback/_incorrect/final/","The correct answer is Deployer. A Provider creates or makes an AI system available under their own brand. A Distributor makes an AI system available for sale without being the original creator. An Importer brings a system from outside the EU for sale within the EU. Company X is simply *using* the AI tool for its own internal business purposes, which defines the Deployer role."

"components/c-514/_feedback/_partlyCorrect/final/","This question has only one correct answer. The correct answer is Deployer, as Company X is using the AI system for its own operations."
