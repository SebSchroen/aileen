# Artificial Intelligence: A Hello World

Welcome to the world of Artificial Intelligence! This is a simple introduction to get you started.

## What is AI?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability of a computer or a robot controlled by a computer to do tasks that are usually done by humans because they require human intelligence and discernment.

## Basic Concepts

*   **Machine Learning (ML):** A subset of AI that involves training machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.
*   **Deep Learning (DL):** A subset of ML that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to analyze data.
*   **Neural Networks:** Computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.

## A Simple Quiz

[( )] Quantum Computing
[(X)] Machine Learning
[( )] Blockchain
[( )] Augmented Reality

## Code Example

Here's a simple example of a Python function that could be used in AI:

````python
def hello_ai():
    print("Hello, AI World!")

hello_ai()
````

This code just prints a message to the console. In real AI applications, you'd have much more complex code!
