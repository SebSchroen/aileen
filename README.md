## About this course

This course provides a comprehensive guide on Artificial Intelligence, with a primary focus on its ethical implications and compliance requirements. The contents fully cover the requlatory requirements of the EU AI Act with respect to AI Literacy. The course starts off by establishing foundational AI concepts, including how models learn and the critical role of training data. Building on this, the course illustrates significant ethical challenges such as AI bias, demonstrating how systems can inadvertently perpetuate societal stereotypes present in their training data.

The compliance segment thoroughly examines the relationship between AI and intellectual property, covering copyright issues related to AI training, output, and authorship. Furthermore, it addresses data protection concerns by detailing how AI processes personal data under regulations like GDPR, highlighting challenges in transparency and consent. The course culminates with an in-depth look at the EU AI Act, categorizing AI risks, defining key roles, and outlining essential legal requirements and prohibited uses for responsible AI deployment.

## How to use this course

This course is available as a SCORM2004 learning module, one of the (still) most widely adopted standards in corporate e-learning. However, SCORM is also the most opinionated framework I ever worked with, so it might not work out of the box.

You can download the SCORM module here:

[scorm2004.zip](https://github.com/SebSchroen/aileen/raw/refs/heads/main/scorm2004.zip)

After downloading, you can upload it to your Learn Management Systems. You find a selection of tested systems below.

## Tested Learn Management Platforms

| Platform         | SCORM 1.2 | SCORM 2004 |
|------------------|-----------|------------|
| Knowledge Worker | ⛔️        | ✅         |
| Moodle           |           | ✅         |
| SCORM Cloud      | ✅        | ✅         |

## Customizations

As stated above, SCORM is highly opinionated and also outtated. Current LMS favor xAPI content. Since the adapt framework is highly customizable, contact me through the contact form on my homepage for customization requests, including additional languages.
