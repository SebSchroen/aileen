That's AI learning your preferences to suggest what you might like next. <br> <br> These are just a few everyday examples that demonstrate one crucial truth: Artificial Intelligence isn't science fiction anymore. It's here, integrated into countless aspects of our lives. In this course, we'll dive in and get a better understanding of what AI is, how it works, and its profound impact on our world.
